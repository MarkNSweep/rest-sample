	<h2>REST</h2>
	<p>
		Inside the project there is a application.rest package
		containing the
		<code>RestEndpoint</code>
		class. This adds a REST endpoint which you can access at <a
			href="rest">/rest</a>
	<p>
		There is also a test class named
		<code>it.rest.RestEndpointTest</code>
		that will test the REST endpoint to ensure it is working.
